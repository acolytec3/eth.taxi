# Web3.ninja

So, how did I become the sole *web3.ninja* on the known internet?  In truth, pretty easily.  Here was my plan:

 - Find a DNS provider that accepts cryptocurrency -- [porkbun](https://www.porkbun.com)
 - Get some cryptocurrency -- done
 - ~~Renew eth.taxi~~ -- nevermind, this cost way too much
 - Find a good new domain name that wasn't going to cost me more than ~0.1 ETH -- web3.ninja
 - ~~Update blog and deploy custom domain on Github Pages~~ - This provded to be a pain
 - Deploy blog on Vercel and add custom domain -- this proved simple.  Thank you, [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com).

 I am now **the** [web3.ninja](https://web3.ninja)

 Am I really a web3 ninja yet?  Probably not, if my blog is still hosted on a Web 2.0 provider.  But, no reason we have to move everything to web3 all at once.
